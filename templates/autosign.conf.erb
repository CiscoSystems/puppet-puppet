# Autosign configuration.  Include if you want to automatically accept any or
# specific puppet client nodes when the join
#
# Useful if you are using something like cobbler to install new nodes and
# are closely managing your nodes and DNS.

# example with wildcard hostname:
# *.example.com

# example with FQDN:
# host.example.com

# You may want to comment this out and go with one of the examples above
# This will allow any "new" host to be autosigned.  Probably ok in
# a lab environment.
